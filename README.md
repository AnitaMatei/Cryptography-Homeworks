## 1) Classic Ciphers
A desktop app that allows chaining multiple classic ciphers - caesar, nihilist, bifid, playfair - in order to encrypt or decrypt the input text. The polybius ciphers use the extended version of the square, which includes special characters and numbers. You can load both keys and the input text from a file.
